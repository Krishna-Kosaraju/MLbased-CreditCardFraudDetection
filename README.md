# Analysis of ML models to best identify Credit Card Fraud 


Welcome to the Credit Card Transactions Analysis and Fraud project! This repository contains the code and analysis for studying credit card transactions by holders in Spain during the year 2013. The dataset used in this project consists of transactions that occurred over two days. The main focus of this project is to compare multiple models to better understand and predict credit card transaction patterns helping to identify fraud.

## Introduction

Credit card transactions play a crucial role in the financial sector, and understanding the patterns and trends in these transactions can help detect fraudulent activities, optimize financial systems, and improve customer services. This project aims to explore and analyze the credit card transactions made by cardholders in Spain during 2013. By employing various machine learning models, we seek to predict transaction patterns and identify potential insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains anonymized credit card transactions made by cardholders in Spain in 2013. The dataset is collected over a span of two days and includes various features related to each transaction, such as transaction amount, merchant type, timestamp, etc. As the data is anonymized, no personally identifiable information is present, ensuring user privacy.

Due to privacy and data usage restrictions, we cannot include the dataset directly in this repository. However, we will provide instructions on how to obtain the dataset and preprocess it for analysis.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are as follows:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory analysis to gain insights into the distribution of transactions, spending patterns, and other relevant trends.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Implement multiple machine learning models to predict transaction patterns and detect anomalies or fraudulent activities.
4. **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of different models based on evaluation metrics and identify the most suitable model for this dataset.
5. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to effectively communicate the results and findings to stakeholders.
6. **Documentation**: Maintain clear and concise documentation throughout the project for better reproducibility.

## Installation

To set up the project environment and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine 
2. Follow the instructions to install .r file

## Models

We plan to explore the following machine learning models for credit card transaction analysis:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
5. XGBoost

The choice of models allows us to compare different approaches and determine the best-fit model for the given dataset.

## Results

The results of our analysis, including model performance metrics and visualizations, will be summarized and discussed in the project report. We will share the key findings and insights obtained from the credit card transaction analysis.
